Master directory (the README you are seeing is in)

EVA6_S4_ASSIGNMENT
   - PART1 --> Calculating the backpropagation for the two input neural network
   	- README.md --> Readme with the detailed explanation of backpropagation and calculation along with the E_TOT VS LEARNING RATE GRAPH & SCREENSHOT OF XLS WORK
	- Fully_connected_NN.xlsx --> XLS File in which the back propagation values are computed for different learning rated and specified inputs
	- E_TOT_GRAPH_VS_LEARNINGRATE.JPG --> (E_TOT convergence graph for different learning rate. Same in README.md as well)
	- NN_BACKPROPAGATION_S4_XLS_SCREENSHOT.JPG --> Screenshot of the work done in XLS (same in README.md as well)
	- Two_input_FCNN.JPG -> Image of the two input network

   - PART2 --> 
        -README.md has the explanation
